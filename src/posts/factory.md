For the first four months of lockdown, I largely ate only two distinct meals.

There were four of us together in the apartment, and as we reckoned with confining ourselves to within the unit, the kitchen steadily became a less appealing space to me. It was a cozy section of an already cozy unit. Now, with all of us working remotely, cooking output was set to skyrocket. Cleanliness was set to plunge. Fingers, set to point. Typical roommate passive-aggressiveness, set to erupt. (Reality turned out not to be so cruel - we entered the lease as friends and we came out as friends, so what more can I ask?)

Nobody needs that kind of stress in their life. So I tried excluding myself from the equation by becoming more efficient in the kitchen. I settled on one recipe. As the lockdown dragged, I got faster at manufacturing the meal. "Cooking" is too generous to describe what happened here. Maybe "meal" is, too. I was a factory, dedicated to a single output.

Anyway, I did say two meals. One was an order of pad see ew from a nearby Thai restaurant - with pork, spice level: 4 out of 5. Old Reliable. Takeout for when I wanted a break. The other: [baked chicken thighs](https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/crispy-baked-chicken-thighs/#wprm-recipe-container-3611) with stir-fried vegetables over white rice.

Cheap, healthy (?????), easy enough... And when you get good, you can optimize your timing by finishing the rice and stir-fry right as the chicken finishes cooking. You can also cook all the veggies ahead of time, meal-prep style, but I personally felt fine spending the five minutes each time cooking those fresh instead of microwaving it along with the chicken and rice. Most of the time savings here has been collected from the forward preparation of chicken and rice, along with the raw simplicity.

Is this recipe better than spending 4 hours on a Sunday preparing distinct lunch and dinner for the rest of the week? Maybe not - you'd get more variety with that kind of planning. But whatever, this one's baked into my mind for life.

The chicken is prepared as described in the link, but for posterity, here's everything you need to do to replicate the meal, day in and day out. Bolded steps are my own.

### Ingredients

- 3 Pounds Chicken thighs, About 6-8
- 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
- 2 Teaspoons Salt
- 2 Teaspoons Garlic Powder
- 2 Teaspoon Onion Powder
- 2 Teaspoons Italian Seasoning
- 1 Teaspoon Black Pepper
- 1 Teaspoon Paprika
- **Bags on bags of frozen, pre-cut vegetables**
- **Vegetable oil**
- **Soy sauce**
- **More black pepper**
- **White rice**

### Instructions

- Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup and set aside.
- Remove the chicken thighs from their packaging. Arrange them on prepared baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil rubbing the oil into the chicken to coat.
- In a small bowl mix together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and paprika. Sprinkle the spices over the chicken evenly.
- Bake chicken in preheated oven for 35-45 minutes.
- **While the chicken is cooking, wash and cook as much rice as possible. Rice cooker, stovetop, whatever gets the job done.**
- **When the chicken finishes cooking, take it out of the oven and let it sit.**
- **Using a wok, stir-fry the frozen vegetables, at least enough for one serving (for me, half a regulation bag from Trader Joe's is the right amount.)**
  - **Get the wok piping hot, then add in the vegetable oil, enough to coat the bottom third of the wok.**
  - **Swirl the oil around to achieve a nice, non-stick surface.**
  - **Add the vegetables with heat on high. Fry until the individual pieces are mostly thawed.**
  - **Add soy sauce and black pepper, to taste. Continue frying until the veggies are cooked to your satisfaction.**
- **Put the rice on a plate. Take two thighs and put on top of the rice. Take the veggies and put on top of all that. Serve immediately.**
- **Store the remaining rice and chicken in the refrigerator so you only have to cook the veggies next time.**
- **Repeat again and again!**
