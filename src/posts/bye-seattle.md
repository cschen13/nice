It doesn't feel right to leave without saying a few words, so let's see.

August 2018. Compensation defined my first year in the city. Compensating for a life of manufactured stress and limited socializing in the before times. Meet everyone, go everywhere. I deserved this. Parties at mine, parties at theirs. Trips to Van and Portland, of course! Always another bar to hit, another friend to meet, more champagne to pop, what are we saying tonight? Visits and victory laps around the country so the boys knew how I was living. The body unfortunately couldn't keep up, so I guess I also deserved that.

Year two, defined by focus. Career anxiety set in, as it always does. Halfway through, the pandemic, too. I moved further from Capitol Hill, my roots and the roots of countless yuppies before me. Made good efforts to maintain friendships, and a new one or two blossomed unexpectedly, though inevitably the circles began to tighten, as they do. But I had moved to a new team at work and that was reinvigorating. It felt like I had something to prove again, and work soon felt like the _only_ place to prove anything. So I leaned inâ„¢.

Year three, coping. Me and the roommate had bought beans and rice that week in 2019 when everything shut down, thinking the world was going to collapse and that somehow we would need rations. Bruh. Who would have thought the collapse would happen in slow motion, and in reverse, and then in slow motion again, complete with the occasional societal convulsion. And we bought beans for that, lmao...

Anyway, I moved into a place for myself, discovered the joys of a kitchen I didn't have to share, and bought a workstation I could be proud of. I also began to truly lose closeness with year 1 folks. Winter 2019 was tough. Honestly, I'm still trying to process all the "empty" time there, but combined with some physical ailments, the only way I knew to cope was to... work more? Brutal. What else could I have done? What _should_ I have done?

Post-vaccine, pre-delta was the biggest fake-out. San Diego, Nashville. Cha Cha, Unicorn, Linda's, it all felt right. Forever grateful for the remaining time I got to spend with my favorites.
